Previously she consulted on foundation fundraising, grant writing, and fundraising planning for environmental nonprofits. Her clients included Yosemite Conservancy, Fair Trade USA, Resource Renewal Institute, Earth Day Quebec, and the Clinton-Guistra Enterprise Partnership. In 2012-13 she collaborated to create 'The SF Bay Area: What Might Have Been', illustrating the unseen conservation history and celebrating those who saved the area's open spaces. During her four years working with the California chapter of The Nature Conservancy, it was hiking with botanists, biologists, and other -ists that strengthened and sealed the deal on her love of the environment and working on its behalf. She lives in Oakland and can’t wait to hike again in the rainforest. Twitter: @victoria_bogdan">
